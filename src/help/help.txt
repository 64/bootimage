Creates a bootable disk image from a Rust kernel

USAGE:
    bootimage [OPTIONS]                 Display help and version information
    bootimage build [BUILD_OPTIONS]     Create a bootable disk image (see below)

OPTIONS:
    -h, --help      Prints help information and exit
    ---version      Prints version information and exit

BUILD_OPTIONS:
    --update-bootloader     Update the bootloader dependency.

    Any additional options are directly passed to `cargo build` (see
    `cargo build --help` for possible options). After building, a bootloader
    is downloaded and built, and then combined with the kernel into a bootable
    disk image.

    For configuration options see `bootimage build --help`.
