Creates a bootable disk image from a Rust kernel and launches it in QEMU

USAGE:
    bootimage run [BUILD_OPTS] -- [RUN_OPTS]        Build and run a disk image

    (for other forms of usage see `bootimage --help`)
    (for BUILD_OPTS see `bootimage build --help`)

RUN_OPTS:
    Any options are directly passed to the run command. Note that the run
    options must be separated from the build options by a "--".

CONFIGURATION:
    The behavior of `bootimage run` can be configured through a
    `[package.metadata.bootimage]` table in the `Cargo.toml`. The
    following options are available to configure run behavior:

    [package.metadata.bootimage]
    # The command invoked with the created bootimage (the "{}" will be replaced
    # with the path to the bootable disk image)
    run-command = ["qemu-system-x86_64", "-drive", "format=raw,file={}"]
    # Additional arguments passed to the run command for non-test executables
    run-args = []
