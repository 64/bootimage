Runs integration tests of a Rust kernel

The following conventions are used:

- All executables starting with `test-` are treated as unit test.
- Tests must print either ok or failed over the serial port. When printing
  failed they can print additional information such as a panic message (in the
  next lines).
- Tests are run with a timeout of 1 minute. If the test has not completed in
  time, it is reported as "timed out".
